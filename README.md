# informal-bug-and-suggestion-tracking
This is a placeholder for discussing simulated data, pipeline, and/or analysis Issues connected to the ers-transit Data Challenge events.

### What is this?
While we’re exploring the data products for the Spring 2022 Data Challenge with Simulated Data, or trying to use the `jwst` pipeline at various stages, we’ll probably encounter some weirdnesses we don't understand or some suggestions we have in mind that might be useful to share with the pipeline or instrument teams. Let's please discuss them as a group! The kinds of things could track here might include:

1. genuine bugs in the `jwst` pipeline, 
2. some weird approximation necessary for the simulations that we should be aware of,
3. general suggestions for how to handle data products or analysis steps
4. areas where we as individuals or a team want to learn more about the tool we’re using, 


If you see something weird that you think might be a bug, find something that needs to be explained better, or you have a suggestion that might be useful for time-series observations with JWST in general, please [post it here as an Issue](https://github.com/ers-transit/informal-bug-and-weirdness-tracking/issues). If many of us agree on them, we may elevate some of these to github Issues for the [actual jwst pipeline](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst). 

### This is a low-stakes place to discuss questions!
Please don't be afraid to post Issues here! We know it can be a little scary to say, "the problem I'm having is big enough that I should inform the JWST pipeline developers". Here, all you need to say is, "here's something that's not acting how I expect, is this weird for other folks too?" So, please post an [Issue!](https://github.com/ers-transit/informal-bug-and-weirdness-tracking/issues).
