# informal-bug-and-weirdness-tracking
This is a placeholder for discussing simulated data and/or pipeline Issues connected to the ers-transit Data Challenge events.

### What is this?
While we’re exploring the data products for the Spring 2022 Data Challenge with Simulated Data, or trying to use the jwst pipeline at various stages, we’ll probably encounter some weirdnesses we don't understand. Any one among us might not know if these are... 

1. genuine bugs in jwst, 
2. some weird approximation necessary for the simulations, or 
3. just that we need to learn more about the tool we’re using, 

... so let's please discuss them as a group. If you see something weird that you think might be a bug, or at least needs to be explained better, [post it here as an Issue](https://github.com/ers-transit/informal-bug-and-weirdness-tracking/issues). Some questions we'll probably be able to answer here; others we'll elevate to github Issues for the [actual jwst pipeline](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jwst). 

### This is a low-stakes place to discuss questions!
Please don't be afraid to post Issues here! We know it can be a little scary to say, "the problem I'm having is big enough that I should inform the JWST pipeline developers". Here, all you need to say is, "here's something that's not acting how I expect, is this weird for other folks too?" So, please post an [Issue!](https://github.com/ers-transit/informal-bug-and-weirdness-tracking/issues).
